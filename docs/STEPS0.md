Here's a **turn-by-turn production cheat-sheet** that maps your 10-minute "_"Batcall Assistant"_ video to the stubbed system you'll build in Phase 0.
(It finishes the "Optional final screen" and shows exactly what has to run in the background at every moment.)

| Asset                   | Stub you'll show                                               | How to prep it quickly                                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **0:10** | Butler TTS: "Hello... password."                                        | `GreeterA` publishes `IntentDetected{ raw:"batman" }`                                               |

| **2:00** | Alfred asks, user responds.                                             | No new Coral traffic yet.                                                                           |

| **7:00** | Narration overlay: animated arrow diagram (gif).                        | Pre-rendered gif; no runtime dependency.                                                            |

## 2. Stub implementation checklist

1. **GreeterA (keyword only)**

   - `"batman"` â†’ `Task.System{ mode:"cave" }`
   - Else route keywords: _read_, _draft_, _schedule_, _task_.

2. **Planner**

   - Maps intent â†’ one downstream `Task.*` with fixed `taskId:"stub-<uuid>"`.

3. **GMailA / GCalA / GTasksA stubs**

   - Single Python FastAPI endpoint `/invoke` returning JSON with `status:"ok"` and a `result_digest` string you want Alfred to speak.

4. **Voice worker**

   - If `TaskCompleted` arrives, just TTS `result_digest`.
   - Ignore payment fields for now.

5. **UI toggles**

   - JavaScript listens to WebSocket from voice worker (`mode:"cave"` event) â†’ add `.dark` class.
   - Email summaries & draft confirmation are static DOM inserts.

## 3. Quick script assets

| Asset                  | File                 | Note                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alfred dark CSS**    | `alfred.css`         | `.dark { background:#0a0a0a; color:#e0e0e0 }`                       |
| **Email HTML snippet** | `emails.html`        | 3 `<div class="mail">â€¦` lines.                                      |
| **Flow GIF**           | `architecture.gif`   | Export from Figma or Keynote.                                       |
| **QR Code**            | `beta_qr.png`        | Points to wait-list Google Form.                                    |
| **Studio layout**      | `studio_preset.json` | Save positions so nodes aren't scattered when you load Studio live. |

## 4. Dry-run "Definition of Ready"

- [ ] Run `docker compose up stub` on Vultr: Studio shows 5 agents.
- [ ] Say "Read my mail" â€“ Alfred UI updates, TTS speaks `(stub) inbox read`.
- [ ] "Scheduleâ€¦" â€“ Studio arrow to GCalA turns green.
- [ ] "I would like to buy groceries tomorrow" â€“ Studio arrow to GTasksA turns green.
- [ ] End screen appears when worker receives "That's all".

Once all green, **record the one-take screencast** and keep moving to Phase 1 (swapping stubs for real Gmail / Calendar / Tasks calls).

That gives you a **fully coherent, visually impressive demo** even if APIs misbehave laterâ€”and judges see the multi-agent choreography in Coral Studio from the first second. Good luck! ðŸŽ¬ðŸ¦‡
