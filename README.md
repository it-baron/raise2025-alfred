# Voice Inbox Concierge: Alfred - Your AI Butler for Digital Life

![Alfred: Voice Inbox Concierge](resources/title.png)

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

In today's hyper-connected world, knowledge workers spend **2.5 hours daily** managing emails, calendars, and tasks - that's **30% of their workday** lost to digital administration. The constant context-switching between Gmail, Google Calendar, and task management tools creates cognitive overload and reduces productivity.

**The Challenge**: How can we transform this fragmented digital workflow into a seamless, voice-driven experience that feels as natural as talking to a personal assistant?

## 💡 Our Solution: Alfred - The Voice-First Digital Butler

Inspired by Batman's loyal butler Alfred Pennyworth, we've created an AI voice assistant that manages your digital life through natural conversation. Using cutting-edge multi-agent orchestration, Alfred handles complex workflows across email, calendar, and task management - all through simple voice commands.

### Key Innovation: Multi-Agent Architecture

Unlike traditional voice assistants that struggle with complex, multi-step tasks, Alfred uses a revolutionary multi-agent system where specialized AI agents collaborate to handle different aspects of your digital life:

- **GreeterA**: The sophisticated butler who understands your intent
- **GMailA**: Your email specialist who drafts, archives, and manages correspondence
- **GCalA**: Your scheduling expert who books meetings and manages your calendar
- **GTasksA**: Your task manager who tracks todos and project progress

## 🚀 Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

1. **Groq API** (Mandatory for Hackathon)

   - Ultra-low latency inference (<100ms)
   - Powers STT, LLM (Llama models), and TTS pipeline
   - Enables real-time voice interactions

2. **Coral Protocol**

   - Revolutionary multi-agent orchestration framework
   - Enables seamless agent-to-agent communication
   - Built-in message routing and state management

3. **LiveKit**

   - WebRTC-based real-time voice communication
   - Sub-second latency for natural conversations
   - Scalable voice infrastructure

4. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
   - Standardized interface for AI-to-API communication
   - Secure credential management
   - Extensible plugin architecture

### Architecture Highlights
